# PI temperature

A repo showing how to extend the android things [contrib driver](https://github.com/androidthings/contrib-drivers/tree/master/bmx280) for the BMX280 ambient sensor to allow for humidity measurements as well.

We're also going to modify the driver so that it allows different I2C addresses, since the contrib driver hardcodes that to 0x77.

See a full write-up of this process in this [blog post](http://zenandroid.io/writing-a-driver-for-android-things-bme280-humidity-sensor/)
